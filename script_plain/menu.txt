stralias grim_1_1_1,Japanese has suffixes called "honorifics" which are attached to people’s names to convey respect and other nuances about the speaker’s relationship with the named person. Some, like sensei, can be (and have been) translated depending on context as "doctor", "teacher", "miss", or other such terms. Others cannot be translated with any consistency, and have been included verbatim. These include:@r@rsan: respect as a common courtesy.@rNo honorific: intimacy, as with close friends, family, or lovers.@rsama: high respect.@rkun: friendly familiarity, normally to a young man; or respect for a subordinate.@rchan: emphasizes femininity, cuteness, or childishness.@r@rFor more detail, see Wikipedia, "Japanese honorifics".
stralias grim_1_2_1,The following family-related terms are used verbatim. They are sometimes used on their own without an attached name.@r@r(o)nii-(san, chan...): older brother, or young adult man.@r(o)nee-(san, chan...): older sister, or young adult woman.@raniki: "bro"; older brother or man senior to the speaker.@raneki: "sis"; older sister or woman senior to the speaker.@r@rYounger siblings would normally be referred to by name only.
stralias grim_1_3_1,In addition to its own symbols, Japanese makes use of Chinese characters, which it calls kanji. Each kanji tends to have a range of "meanings" associated with it, and kanji are put together to make words.@rMany kanji can be pronounced or "read" in several different ways, and usually only one reading will be correct for any particular word.@rFor instance, "Tokyo"  has the kanji  (east, tou)  (capital, kyou).  can also be read "higashi", but "Higashikyou" will not be understood; the word  must be read with the "tou-kyou" reading.@r@rSometimes, however, the kanji readings have to be ignored, and the word has to be pronounced in a unique way of its own.@r@rFor example, Battler’s name is .@r means fight and its readings are sen, ikusa, and tataka(u).@r means person and its readings are jin, nin, hito, ri, and to.@rAnyone first encountering the unique name  would probably try to read it as something like "Sento". No one would guess that he is called "Battler"!@rNot only is the reading of his name impossible to guess, but it is also an English word, and doesn’t sound remotely like a Japanese name.
stralias grim_1_4_1,Derived from "Namu Amida Butsu", a Buddhist prayer, meaning "I follow the Amida Buddha". It is also known as the "nembutsu".@rOften heard in contracted forms like "nanmaida" or "namunamu", it is recited to express mindfulness of the Buddha.@rAfter the passing of a relative, this sutra is often chanted to express thankfulness and knowledge that the dead have been allowed into Amida’s Pure Land (paradise).@r@rMost Japanese funerals are conducted as Buddhist ceremonies, and Japanese culture in general is full of rituals and religious customs, but it is common to participate in these traditions regardless of one\'s own personal religious belief. The country is largely secular.
stralias grim_1_5_1,In Japanese, men and women traditionally (or perhaps stereotypically) speak differently, and this difference is much larger than what you find in English.@r@rJessica’s speech is masculine, blunt, casual, and assertive.@rIn Japanese, this is quite evident in a majority of her lines, using assertive and traditionally "male" particles like  (ze), and casual, slangy contractions.
stralias grim_1_6_1,A torii is a ceremonial entry gate to a Shinto shrine. It is usually red and has a very recognizable and prominent square shape ({f:0:{d:30:⛩}}), consisting of two vertical or slightly inward-tilted pillars joined by two extended horizontal bars, one crowning the pillars and the other just below. Sometimes many torii are used in series along a path.
stralias grim_1_7_1,In Japanese, Maria uses her own name instead of the word "I" when talking about herself. This is called "illeism", and is common among young Japanese children. It sounds childish and cute in Japanese, and can be used by young adult women to achieve the same effect.@r@rEven the other characters have various ways of referring to themselves, because Japanese has more than one word for "I".@rKinzo, Nanjo, Eva, Jessica, and a number of other characters use watashi, which is a neutral way of saying "I".@rBattler uses ore, which is a masculine, self-asserting, and very casual way of saying it.@rGeorge uses boku, which has a youthful, boyish, casual, and humble feel.@rHideyoshi uses washi, which goes along with his strange accent and makes him sound older.@rThere are many others.@r@rHowever, you will not always hear these words being used, just as you will not always hear Maria using her own name, because Japanese is a pro-drop language: words like "I", "you", "it", and so on are often simply left out when it\'s obvious who or what is being talked about.
stralias grim_1_8_1,A kotatsu is a table-heater hybrid often used as an inexpensive way to keep warm in Japan during the cold months.@rIt consists of a low-height table frame, designed for use while sitting on the floor, with a heat source built into the underside of the frame. This is covered by a thick blanket to trap the heat, and a table top rests on top.@rThe blanket can be removed, so the kotatsu can be used like a regular table.
stralias grim_1_9_1, (asougi) and  (nayuta) are very large ancient Japanese numbers. Modern Japanese is more likely to express numbers of this size using powers of 10, just like Western languages.@rThe English counting system expresses numbers using a thousands-based system (thousand, ×1000 = million, ×1000 = billion, ×1000 = trillion, ...), but Japanese uses a system based on ten-thousands instead, which can make converting between the two quite confusing.@r@rFrom 1 all the way up to nayuta, it goes:@r, ichi, 1 (one)@r, man, 10000 = 10⁴ (ten thousand)@r, oku, 10000² = 10⁸ (hundred million)@r, chou, 10000³ = 10¹² (one trillion)@r, kei, 10000⁴ = 10¹⁶ (ten quadrillion)@r, gai, 10000⁵ = 10²⁰ (hundred quintillion)@r(From about here, the numbers are not common knowledge.)@r, jo, 10000⁶ = 10²⁴ (one septillion)@r, jou, 10000⁷ = 10²⁸ (ten octillion)@r, kou, 10000⁸ = 10³² (hundred nonillion)@r, kan, 10000⁹ = 10³⁶ (one undecillion)@r, sei, 10000¹⁰ = 10⁴⁰ (ten duodecillion)@r, sai, 10000¹¹ = 10⁴⁴ (hundred tredecillion)@r, goku, 10000¹² = 10⁴⁸ (one quindecillion)@r, gougasha, 10000¹³ = 10⁵² (ten sexdecillion)@r, asougi, 10000¹⁴ = 10⁵⁶ (hundred septdecillion)@r, nayuta, 10000¹⁵ = 10⁶⁰ (one novemdecillion)@r@rMultiplied together, asougi and nayuta give a number so large that it doesn’t have a Japanese name!
stralias grim_1_10_1, (Inari) is the Shinto god of foxes, agriculture, fertility, rice, tea, and sake, and is one of the most revered and major of the Shinto gods.@rInari is depicted differently by time and place, and may be male, female, or even a plurality of gods.@r@rOver a third of Japan’s Shinto shrines are dedicated to Inari, and feature torii and statues of kitsune. The kitsune are white foxes that are Inari’s benevolent messengers, but they can be malicious and bring about grave disasters.

stralias grim_2_1_1, (seiza) is a traditional Japanese manner of sitting, used for formal occasions where respect is demanded.@rTo sit in seiza-style, you kneel on the floor or on a cushion, with your legs folded under your thighs, and sit on your heels, with the tops of your feet entirely flat on the floor, and big toes overlapping.@r@rThe position can be quite uncomfortable to maintain for long periods of time, especially for those unaccustomed to it.
stralias grim_2_2_1,The color of  (ao) in Japanese has a range of meanings, including "pale", "fresh", "young", "naive", and the colors "blue" and "green", in one word. The sea and sky are ao, fresh grass is ao, and so is the green on a traffic light.@r@rNowadays, Japanese has a native word midori for the color green, but the use of the broad word "ao" is still very common, and this is the color Shannon uses to refer to the sea. Kanon wonders if she is using "ao" to mean something other than blue.
stralias grim_2_3_1,Tsundora is the word "tundra" converted into the Japanese sound system. It is used as a pun and reference to the term tsundere, which is a well-known character personality trait in fictional Japanese works.@r@rTsundere is composd of two words, tsuntsun and deredere, meaning respectively "aloof or cranky" and "lovestruck".@rIt is used to describe characters that demonstrate an aggressive and/or cold behavior (tsuntsun) but then become all lovey-dovey (deredere) under some circumstances.
stralias grim_2_4_1,Duck and green onions are the primary ingredients for a duck stew, and this gave rise to the Japanese phrase "a duck comes bearing green onions", in which a duck approaches carrying its own seasoning, ready to be eaten.@rThis metaphorically refers to a situation where a series of lucky coincidences benefits you without any effort, or alternatively, where a naive person brings you what you want while unaware of the disadvantage to themselves. @rPerhaps because of this, a "mark" or a "sucker" in terms of scams is often called a "duck" in Japanese.

stralias grim_3_1_1,This word is probably related to a fictional unit of length from "Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind", which seems to be about one meter long.
stralias grim_3_2_1,Characters sometimes discuss their interpretations of the epitaph.@rIf you would like to explore the epitaph, you may find it interesting to browse their discussions in the Message Browser. Additional translation notes may sometimes appear.
stralias grim_3_3_1,Katakana is one of the phonetic scripts used in Japanese writing, one of its uses being to write foreign words.@rWhen foreign words are written in katakana, they are forced into the Japanese sound system, so "BEATRICE" in katakana  is actually pronounced "Beatoriiche". This Japanized pronunciation of BEATRICE is the reason for her nickname of "Beato".@r@rIn this scene, Battler is suggesting that she should write the name in its original beautiful form instead of the Japanized version.@rHowever, as we have just seen with Maria, a katakana name-which we have represented with small caps-may be a deliberate choice for certain characters, witches in particular.@r@rIn the original Japanese, many characters, including ordinary real-world characters like Kumasawa "Chiyo" , as well as Ronove, the Chiesters, and all the stakes, use katakana names. To ease reading, we have chosen to restrict the usage of small caps to the full names of witches, where katakana seems to have a special significance.
stralias grim_3_4_1,Short for "gal games" ("girl games"). The term generally describes non-adult visual novels that feature attractive girls as a main hook, including but not limited to dating sims. The definition of the term is fuzzy, and it may also be used in a wider sense that includes adult games.

stralias grim_4_1_1,The Japanese confectionery company Glico, also famous for producing Pocky, began its business in 1922 with boxes of Glico caramels, which featured art of a running man, triumphantly smiling with his arms raised. The marketing was that a single caramel gives you the energy to run {nobr:300 m}.@r@rThe Glico running man became an iconic trademark and mascot that the company still uses today.
stralias grim_4_2_1,Shotoku Taishi, or Prince Shotoku (574–622), is the extremely culturally influential Japanese regent depicted on the old 5000-yen and 10000-yen Japanese banknotes issued from 1958–1986. His name was used to refer to those notes informally.@r@rIn modern Japan, 10000-yen notes are sometimes referred to as "Yukichi" after Fukuzawa Yukichi, the figure on the new 10000-yen banknote that entered circulation in 1984.
stralias grim_4_3_1, (chazuke), known as "bubuzuke" in Kyoto where Sumadera Kasumi is from, is green tea poured over rice with savory toppings.@rIt is said that in Kyoto, offering chazuke to a guest is often not meant sincerely, but is merely a way of indicating in a roundabout fashion that it is time for the guest to leave, and the guest is expected to know when to refuse.@r@rEffectively, in this scene, Tetsuro brazenly steals a phrase from Kasumi\'s own cultural roots to tell her not to let the door hit her on the way out.
stralias grim_4_4_1,When peanuts that have been removed from their shells are cracked in half, one half has a nub on the end with small leaves protruding from it.@rIn Japan, young children are sometimes told that the half with this nub is the grandpa, because the leaves look like a moustache.@r@rThe other half, obviously, would be the grandma.
stralias grim_4_5_1,Shiritori is a Japanese word game. Players take in turns to say words, and each word must begin with the last Japanese character of the previous word, forming a chain.@r@rOnly nouns are allowed, and accidentally saying a word that ends with the character "n"  loses you the game, because no Japanese word begins with "n" (a word like "ninja", for example, begins with "ni" , not "n").@r@rThe exact rules for what is allowed and what exactly constitutes "the last character" often vary and need clarification.
stralias grim_4_6_1,"Udaikan" is a misreading of the "Ushiromiya" kanji .@r@rThe officer mistook the last kanji  (miya) for  (kan).@r@rThis would also have caused him to pick the wrong reading for  due to the existence of the word  (daikan, magistrate).
stralias grim_4_7_1,A "communication booklet" is a notebook which elementary schoolers in Japan take to school with them, used as a short-message communication tool between parents and teachers.@r@rFor instance, the students will be told to write down information that parents need to know about the next day of classes; parents can use them to keep teachers informed of lost items, health issues, or request that their child skips a gym class; and because children tend to go to school in groups, notices of absence or lateness can also be written in them and the booklet handed to the group.
stralias grim_4_8_1,These are references to modern Japanese fashion subcultures.@r@r"Alice and the Graveyard" references "Alice and the Pirates", a gothic/pirate-punk lolita fashion brand.@r@r"666" references the famous department and fashion store "109" in Shibuya, Japan\'s popular youth culture district.@r@rFinally, "Devilish Pretty" is a reference to "Angelic Pretty", a very famous sweet lolita fashion brand.
stralias grim_4_9_1,The term "flag" here originally described an invisible state value in a game\'s coding, which is said to be "tripped" or "triggered" when the player takes some action that influences future events.@rThe moment of the flag trip itself is usually not visible, and can only be detected through later changes in dialogue or events that signal to the player that they have impacted events or changed route.@r@rIn casual usage of the term, and especially when applying the concept to a non-interactive medium, these moments that indicate clearly to the genre-savvy that events are inexorably unfolding a certain way are themselves called "flags", and it is in this sense that the phrase "loser flag" is used here: to refer to the occurrence of a cliché that is almost always followed by total failure for a character in a story.

stralias grim_5_1_1, (Donburi) is simply "food served on top of rice in a deep bowl". The bowl is also called a "donburi", hence the name.@r@rMany types of food can be served donburi style, including curry (karee-don), beef (gyuu-don), or chicken and egg (oyako-don, meaning "parent and child donburi").
stralias grim_5_2_1, (Shin-Honkaku, New Orthodox) is a genre of Japanese mystery novels intended as pure logical puzzles to be solved by the reader, taking inspiration from the works of Golden Age detective fiction and the ideas of S.S. Van Dine.@rThe rise of the New Orthodox movement, which revived and revolutionized the genre of orthodox detective fiction in Japan, can be attributed to Shimada Souji\'s "The Tokyo Zodiac Murders" in 1981 and Ayatsuji Yukito\'s seminal work "The Decagon House Murders" in 1987.@r@rShin-Honkaku is the third wave of detective fiction in Japan, preceded decades earlier by less well-known works such as "The Case of the Murder on D. Hill" (Edogawa Rampo, 1925) and "The Non-Serial Murder Case" (Sakaguchi Ango, 1949). The latter was part of an earlier movement known as  (Shin-Gesaku, New Burlesque) which bucked the trends of pre-war Japanese literature.
stralias grim_5_3_1,Ina Bauer (1941–2014) was a champion German figure skater, whose name is associated with a move in figure skating that became famous in Japan.@r@rHowever, the reference goes deeper than this. Rudolf\'s voice actor, Koyama Rikiya , was the Japanese dub voice for Jack Bauer in the TV series "24" (2001–2010).@r"He never dies" is a reference to one of a number of comedic Japanese TV commercials for 24, in which Koyama Rikiya sings: "I am Jack Bauer, always in danger / I am Jack Bauer, I never die".
stralias grim_5_4_1,Lake Shirakaba is a reference to "Onmoraki no Kizu" , an award-winning 2003 novel by Kyougoku Natsuhiko .@rThe Human-hunting Count is a reference to "Galaxy Express 999".

stralias grim_6_2_1, (Warawa) is the pronoun that BEATRICE used throughout Episodes 1 through 4 to refer to herself.@r@rHistorically, warawa (written ) was a word used to refer to handmaids, chambermaids, and children, including errand boys and girls. The pronoun warawa which derived from these meanings was therefore a humble one, used mostly by women.@r@rHowever, in the context of modern fiction, the use of warawa is stereotypically associated with noblewomen from olden times, and the anachronism of this choice of pronoun can have the secondary effect of imparting an imperious air on a character\'s speech.@rIn this sense, it is a perfect fit for BEATRICE, and an important part of the role language that makes up her character.

The player with "advantage" says "acchi muite" ("look that way"), and then, in time with a call of "hoi!", he or she points one finger either up, down, left, or right. At the same time, the other player turns their head, also in one of those four directions. If the player with advantage correctly predicts which way the other will turn, they win.
