To my beloved magic apprentice,
~Important Facts Concerning Magic~
To my beloved Maria...
For someone studying magic, it is crucial to know that magic usage requires the correct mind frame. 
For you who yearns to be a witch, you should know that magic is essentially the power of yearning.
Learn this as soon as possible, as I believe you may want to show your magic off a bit to someone.
However, magic is the sole element with a power deep enough to quench all ignorance in the world.
Both paying utmost respect to magic and having a suitable mind frame for it will be necessary.
While having the impure desire to show off your magic to someone, the mysterious power behind your magic will never show.
In no way is magic something like doing some petty sleight of hand that you don\'t usually see.
Pray, Maria, that you may respect magic.
I pray from the depths of my heart that you take the first step as a witch with the right mind frame.
――The Golden Beatrice
"Do remember, Maria, you must never forget the thankful feelings that magic is comprised of. Even as someone like me, who is at the peak of wickedness, you must never forget these feelings."
"Uu. Thankful?"
"That\'s right. In this world, with the multitudes upon multitudes of people who are begging for a miracle, magic is what can make them come true."
"There are no witches who exercise magic. Witches exercise miracles for those who pray for them. ... Perhaps consider when people would pray for rain. All of those people suffering from a drought would beg to the heavens for rain, and what results is rain pouring down. That\'s because their prayers arrived in heaven, so rain was sure to begin to fall."
"If the wish didn\'t arrive, would even Beato not be able to use magic...?"
"Theoretically speaking, yes. But wondering about whether or not a wish would arrive is an apprentice level worry. When you reach my level, wishes will "always arrive". A wish that is sure to come true can no longer be called a wish. Therefore, it\'s called magic. Heeheehee...!"
"I\'m thankful. If rain fell on swimming lesson day, I\'d be brimming with thankfulness!"
"That\'s right. Let me spare you a bit of trouble for the sake of your own goal. You must never forget these thankful feelings. ... And also, no matter what manner of power you are given, as a result, you must not forget these thankful feelings."
"For example, Maria prays so that maybe rain can make her swimming lessons get interrupted. The sky gets cloudy, and little raindrops might start pattering, but suppose the interruption doesn\'t happen. At that point, she must not be disappointed."
"Why this is, is because although your wish is for your lessons to get halted, that isn\'t what the heavens hope happen. Your wish for rain to fall is asking the heavens too much. At that point, if you were to be disappointed, that would be highly disrespectful. With those kinds of feelings, the heavens may never lend you their power again."
"But if I get to be like Beato, could I cause a downpour or call up a typhoon right now?"
"Of course that\'s possible. Surrounding this island in a typhoon and separating it from the rest of the world would be quite easy."
"Show me show me! Call a typhoon right now!! And then the boat trip will get cancelled, and Maria can get away with not going to school tomorrow―!"
"Maria, those feelings are quite disrespectful. The larger the magic power, the larger the power you will be borrowing from the great ones. This requires a proportional amount of respect. Great magic like in calling a typhoon cannot be performed with such a half joking mindset. You will get disqualified as a witch."
"...Uu. Sorry."
We witches must not forget that the name magic itself is disrespectful in nature.
Why this is, is because in this world full of all this power and phenomena, a miracle is bound to happen. And yet, there is nothing that allows the world to receive these miracles naturally.
For example... people feel thankful to get up every morning of every day, right? No, no one is actually that grateful. However, this is a huge miracle. God\'s love for us is probably massive, so much that consequently, every morning He naturally shines on us. But this has never been something that should be taken for granted.
If at any point, God\'s affection for humanity were to burn out, so would the sun. Every single day until today, there has been no guarantee that the sun will rise again tomorrow.
We witches do not make light of this.
Every morning, I am thankful for the fact that the same sun from yesterday rose again.
The fact that I am able to accept these warm days is a blessing that I am thankful for. And then occasionally, to let the daily cycles be rewarded and relax themselves, I\'ll ask for a solar eclipse.
The sun has never slept once. Every being and every phenomenon in the world must all be thankful to it.
An apple falling from a tree is thanks to gravity. If there were no gravity, we would likely not be able to continue walking. The fact the ocean is full, the fact that wind blows, the fact that fire raises, whichever trivial thing along with everything and anything. We should all be thankful, for it is the miracle of a great being.
In essence, all miracles along with everything else would die out without these thankful feelings.
When you think about it this way, can you understand why magic being called that way is disrespectful?
There are no witches who exercise magic. Witches wish, receive, and give thanks.
Forget those feelings, and the ability to deal with "magic" will forever be out of reach.
In the end, "everything" in this world is a miracle.
When humans called this a "phenomenon" caused by a mechanical reaction, magical power suddenly began disappearing.
For instance, when a cow gives milk, you should be thankful for the miracle.
Since they were cared for, it\'s expected that they would provide the miracle of rewarding their owners with milk.
Nevertheless, humanity instead forgets their thanks to cows, constantly breeds them mechanically, and treats this milk producing machine as a "phenomenon".
As a result, cows then lose their divinity, and the miracle lying within "is killed".
This sort of thing was done to all creations everywhere. One by one, each miracle was killed. Things that were sacred were killed.
... No, killed isn\'t the correct expression for this. To say they were "rejected" is more correct.
Why this is, is that anything like humans cannot kill and erase these precious beings among other things. At best, all they can do is just reject these beings and act like they don\'t see it.
This is because humanity killed however many miracles, acting as if they didn\'t exist, so the overflowing amount of miracles in this world have no choice but to end up being denied at some point.
This world is overflowing with miracles. This truth alone will never change.
Nonetheless, the issue with the humans of today\'s world is that they are too excellent with "that sort of power". Their ability to cause the decline of the power of miracles with "phenomena" is too excellent. They became an overwhelming majority as they "started to hunt miracles" full force.
They half made it into a living finding every miracle they could, pouring their own blood, sweat, and tears into causing their decline.
In its truest meaning, this is the dawn of the era of the witch hunt.
Both the power of miracles and the sacred ones who governed them began to hate and avoid humans.
That\'s right. At last, humans have become able to repel miracles using their body odor, like the smelly pigs they are. Just by existing, the power of miracles disappears. Just by existing, the existence of us witches is denied.
And since they swagger all over the place in groups, the places where magic can be used are already running low. For that reason, we hid away from human eyes, and were forced to flee to far-off places.
... And now, this remote oriental island, where such few people live, is where I have taken residence.
Now, it is essential to hide our magic powers from human eyes. We cannot show miracles to humans.
Humans themselves reject and deny magic just through their social standing. When I try to show them a miracle through magic, it causes it to dispel right in front of me.
Having your powers stolen by humans even just being around, having your magic dispelled like that, what humiliation...!
So, I\'ve decided that even if I cannot show my magic, it isn\'t impossible to acknowledge me as a witch.
If I can\'t show my magic and prove that I\'m a witch, I\'ll accomplish something only possible through magic so that they won\'t have a choice but to acknowledge me. And if all "phenomena" get denied, good.
This may be a formidable and far-reaching proof. Surely, this is the straightforward method of the devil\'s proof. No, fitting for me, maybe I\'ll show them my "witch\'s proof".
Time will forever exist. I\'ll repeat it as many times as it takes to make these foolish humans succumb to me. This, for sure, is the eternal torture I will dole out to them.
Exiled are those who are sacred, to the punishment that lies beyond the door of desecrated miracles.
